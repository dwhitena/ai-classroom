# AI Classroom
This repository includes materials (code, data config, etc.) for the live, online training called [AI Classroom](https://datadan.io/). Note, the material has been designed to be taught in a virtual classroom environment. The code is well commented but missing many of the contextual concepts and ideas that will be covered in the class.

If you need further help productionizing AI workflows, want to bring this training to your company, or just have ML/AI related questions, Daniel is here to help! Reach out via [this email](mailto:dan@datadan.io).
